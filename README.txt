Unity_Scripts
A collection of simple C# scripts I've used in my Unity project : Isles of Dunya

DestroyerScript     : destroys target object upon collision with Player + adds to score
PlantRustle         : plays animation on target 3D model upon collision with Player (plant moves)
PlayerOnMovingLedge : handles physics for when Player steps onto moving ledge
RespawnScript       : when Player falls off; triggers respawn to beginning of level
SignTrigger         : triggers animation for close-up of sign when Player is close enough
